Intro
-----

This directory contains the sources of msh, a mini-shell for UZI180.
Currently msh implements the following features:

- I/O redirection and pipes.
- Background execution of processes.
- Environment variable manipulations.
- Wildcard expansion


Command line options
--------------------

 -c  - temporary shell

 -l  - login shell


Builtin commands
----------------

cd  - change the current working directory to the one specified, or
      to the user's home directory if none specified.

exit - exit the shell. If a numeric argument follows, it will be used
       as exit code.

sync - sync disks (flush UZI180 internal cache)

umask - print or set the current umask value


I tried to keep the code size as small as possible without sacrificing
too much functionality. That's why it looks kind of weird.

The prompt shows the current working directory and a dollar sign '$'
(a hash '#' if running with root privileges) as a prompt character.

The command syntax closely follows the standard sh conventions:

- spaces or tabs are used to separate the different command elements
  (program names and arguments)

- I/O redirection uses the following characters: '<' for stdin, '>' for
  stdout, and the combination '>&' for stderr. A file or device name must
  follow.

- The vertical bar '|' is used to interconnect commands via pipes (i.e. to
  send the stardard output from one program to the standard input of
  another).

- The ampersand '&' at the end of a command starts the corresponding program
  in the background.
